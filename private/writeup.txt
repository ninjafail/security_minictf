Vulnerability:
  The key is finite and starts at the beginning again once enough messages have been encrypted with OTP.

Attack:
- get encrypted flag and its length
- get (multiple of) keylength by encrypting unknown message (with known length) until duplicate is found
- reset key
- encrypt unknown message until you reach start of key
- encrypt known message with which you can obtain part of the key (we know plain text and ciphertext at this area)
- use this part of the key to obtain plain text flag
    plain_flag = encr_flag XOR encr_msg XOR plain_msg
             ( = plain_flag XOR key[0:flag_len] XOR plain_msg XOR key[0:plain_msg_len] XOR plain_msg )

This attack is implemented in 'exploit.py'.

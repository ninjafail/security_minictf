Attack:
- get flag length
- get (multiple of) keylength by encrypting unknown message (with known length) until duplicate is found
- reset key
- encrypt unknown message until you reach start of key
- encrypt known message with which you can obtain part of the key (we know plain text and cyphertext at this area)
- use this part of the key to obtain plain text flag

This attack is implemented in 'exploit.py'.
